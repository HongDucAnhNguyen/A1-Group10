-- Sort Description
Bogosort, also called Stupid Sort, Dumb Sort, or Monkey Sort, is the slowest sorting algorithm we could find.
To put it simply, bogosort works by taking in an array of comparable objects, checking if it is sorted,
and shuffling the array around if it is not. There is no real logic to the sort. It can take years for an
array to even be sorted.

-- Complexity Analysis
O((n + 1)!)
The best case scenario for a bogosort is when it is presented with an already sorted array.
It is unpredictable otherwise.

-- Algorithm Steps
1. Loop is array sorted?
2. True - return sorted array
3. False - shuffle array around and repeat loop
